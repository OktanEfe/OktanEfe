Hi, I’m Oktan Efe.
I am a graduate of Information Systems Engineering from Kocaeli University. I chose this field because of my strong interest in technology and my passion for working with computers. Throughout my education and professional journey, I have developed solid experience in both technical and creative disciplines, and I continue to improve myself by building modern, user-focused web solutions as a freelance web developer.
